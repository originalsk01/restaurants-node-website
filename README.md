# Restaurant Node Website

This is a project which uses EJS, NodeJS, HTML and CSS to render a website!

## Getting started

To be able to run this website you will need to have NodeJS and NPM installed. You can download [NodeJS here](https://nodejs.org/en) and use the Node installer to install both NodeJS and NPM!

Once you have installed those and cloned the repo you can run `npm install` to download the required packages and then `npm start` to get the project running!

## Notes on the website

This website uses EJS to load HTML content dynamically and shares object like the header across multiple files. Check the **views/includes** directory to see which shared templates are used across web pages!

Any new restaurants are added to the **data** folder and loaded into the **Browse Restaurant Page**
